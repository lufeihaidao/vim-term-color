vim term colors
==================
It's a collection of colors that can be used in terminal mode, rather than only in GUIs.

Thanks to [gui2term project](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2778), I can use my favorite color in terminal(gnome-terminal or kde-console).

Fork me to provide your favorite color! Or just tell me the color name.
